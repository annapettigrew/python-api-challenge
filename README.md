# python-api-challenge

### In this homework, we were tasked to analyze a Weather API. I created a series of charts and plots to visualize how the weather changes depending on conditions such as:

#### - Proximity to the Equator
#### - Cloudiness
#### - Humidity
#### - Wind Speed
#### - Max Temperature


### Next I created a Heat Map to show a strong visual of the levels of Humidity around the world. 
### Then Proceeded to map the closest hotels to a set of ideal weather conditions. These conditions were the following:

#### - A max temp lower than 80 but higher than 70
#### - Wind Speeds les than 10mph
#### - Zero Cloudiness

## Observations
### - The closer you get to the equator line, the higher the temperature will be.
### - The further away from the equator line you get, there is a chance of higher wind speeds.
### - In the Southern Hemisphere, it gets more humid the more you move away from the equator line.
