# python-api-challenge

### In this homework, we were tasked to analyze a Weather API. I created a series of charts and plots to visualize how the weather changes depending on conditions such as:

#### - Proximity to the Equator
#### - Cloudiness
#### - Humidity
#### - Wind Speed
#### - Max Temperature


### Next I created a Heat Map to show a strong visual of the levels of Humidity around the world. 
### Then Proceeded to map the closest hotels to a set of ideal weather conditions. These conditions were the following:

#### - A max temp lower than 80 but higher than 70
#### - Wind Speeds les than 10mph
#### - Zero Cloudiness
