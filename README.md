# python-api-challenge

### In this homework, we were tasked to analyze a Weather API. I created a series of charts and plots to visualize how the weather changes depending on conditions such as:

#### - Proximity to the Equator
#### - Cloudiness
#### - Humidity
#### - Wind Speed
#### - Max Temperature
